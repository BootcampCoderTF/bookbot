# bookbot
BookBot is my first project!

A command-line application in Python that does static analysis on text files, or rather, entire novels like "Frankenstein".
The app opens and prints the entire novel in the command-line followed by a report that counts the total number of words in the text
and the number of times each letter appears in the text and excludes special characters, spaces and new lines!
