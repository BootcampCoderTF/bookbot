# bookbot
BookBot is my first project!

A command-line application in Python that does static analysis on text files, or rather, entire novels like "Frankenstein".
The app opens and prints the entire novel in the command-line followed by a report that counts the total number of words in the text,
as well as the number of times each letter appears in the text while excluding special characters, spaces and blank new lines!
